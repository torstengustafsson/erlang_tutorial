# EUnit

http://erlang.org/doc/apps/eunit/chapter.html#Unit_testing

EUnit is a testing framework for Erlang. Got all the usual stuff, like mock objects, unit testing etc.

EUnit will recognise functions anding with "\_test()" as eUnit test functions and automatically export them.

It will also automatically recognise a file "module_name_test.erl" as a file where tests for a module file named "module_name.erl" is defined.

Tests can be generated by defining a function ending in "\_test\_()", which is recognised by eUnit as a test generator function.

simple example:

    basic_test_() ->
      fun () -> ?assert(1 + 1 =:= 2) end.

# PropEr

PropEr is a testing framework that work together with eUnit, with focus on property based testing.

PropEr is an Erlang project that is built with Rebar (an Erlang buildtool). The 'rebar' command is included in the project (Rebar3 is the newest version, but PropEr seems to use the original version).
